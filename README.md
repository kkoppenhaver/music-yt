This is a list of some of my favorite music-related related videos on Youtube. If a video is on this list, it either taught me something about music, just made me smile, or in the best cases, both. If you'd like to suggest a video that you think belongs on this list, read the Contributing section below. Happy listening!

## The List

[Hopeless Wanderer (Official Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rId6PKlDXeU)

Best known for their roles in Arrested Development, SNL, The Office, and The Last Man on Earth, Mumford and Sons<sup>*</sup> deliver a hilarious performance in this music video for one of their more popular songs.

\* Not actually Mumford and Sons

[Canadian Brass: Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l-E3kyNcag)

The premise of NPR's Tiny Desk Concert series is simple: bring a musician or musicians behind a tiny desk to perform their music in a much more acoustic, intimate setting. The artists go behind the scenes and tell some of the stories behind the music that normally wouldn't have come out. I particularly like this performance because I think it's so different from most of the other Tiny Desk performances. And the tuba feature doesn't hurt either.

[Avicii - Without You (AFISHAL Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCIFdJMl8S0)

There's a lot to say about this one. The fact that the graphics are synched to a completle custom audio/visual controller, the rhythm needed to keep everything together and the fact that it's not even his song all makes this just one really amazing video. If you're a fan of Avicii, Crash Bandicoot, Mario, impressive percussion, or even just amazing hardware builds, there's something in here for you.

[Pokemon Trainer Battle - Rock Jazz Orchestra Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfugR2vLARY)
This is equal parts nostalgia and awesomeness. This takes the Pokemon Trainer battle music and mashes it up with something that sounds the the soundtrack from The Incredibles and ends up coming out with an amazing result. I would recommend checking out their entire channel if you want some classic video game music reimagined, but this one is in my #1 spot because of the orchestration and just sheer depth of the arrangement.

[Mr. Curiosity - Jason Mraz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZeSZEvcck)
If you've never seen Jason Mraz live, you're hontesly missing out. But this video is the closest you'll get without actually being in the same building. It's just him and a keyboard, despite the middle section where you might be convinced he's hired the sporano from the local opera to help him onstage. The way he goes between falsetto and his regular voice is honeslty insane. He makes it sound so easy and that alone will keep you coming back again and again.

[Imagine - Chris Kläfford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVO8gjn3dFg)
I've heard lots of Beatles covers, but none captures the emotion of the lyrics quite like this cover by Chris Kläfford. The raw feeling he puts into the song and the break between his amazingly raspy chest voice and his head voice (which some might call a quasi-yodel) makes this cover for me. This rendition is something I could both have on in the background when I'm working while at the same time being something I could pay complete attention to when I'm all up in my feelings.
