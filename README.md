# MusicYT
This is a list of some of my favorite music-related related videos on Youtube. If a video is on this list, it either taught me something about music, just made me smile, or in the best cases, both. If you'd like to suggest a video that you think belongs on this list, read the Contributing section below. Happy listening!
