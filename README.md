This is a list of some of my favorite music-related related videos on Youtube. If a video is on this list, it either taught me something about music, just made me smile, or in the best cases, both. If you'd like to suggest a video that you think belongs on this list, read the Contributing section below. Happy listening!

## The List

[Hopeless Wanderer (Official Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rId6PKlDXeU)

Best known for their roles in Arrested Development, SNL, The Office, and The Last Man on Earth, Mumford and Sons<sup>*</sup> deliver a hilarious performance in this music video for one of their more popular songs.

\* Not actually Mumford and Sons

[Canadian Brass: Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l-E3kyNcag)

The premise of NPR's Tiny Desk Concert series is simple: bring a musician or musicians behind a tiny desk to perform their music in a much more acoustic, intimate setting. The artists go behind the scenes and tell some of the stories behind the music that normally wouldn't have come out. I particularly like this performance because I think it's so different from most of the other Tiny Desk performances. And the tuba feature doesn't hurt either.

[Avicii - Without You (AFISHAL Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCIFdJMl8S0)

There's a lot to say about this one. The fact that the graphics are synched to a completle custom audio/visual controller, the rhythm needed to keep everything together and the fact that it's not even his song all makes this just one really amazing video. If you're a fan of Avicii, Crash Bandicoot, Mario, impressive percussion, or even just amazing hardware builds, there's something in here for you.
